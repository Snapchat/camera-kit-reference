# Camera Kit Sample Custom Lenses Carousel and Camera Preview

This example app shows how to create a custom carousel for your lenses and use a custom layout to
display a camera preview with lenses applied using Camera Kit.

## Build

Open project's `gradle.properties` file and enter values for `com.snap.camerakit.api.token` from [Snap Kit Developer Portal](https://snapkit.com/manage)  and `com.snap.camerakit.lenses.group.id` from  your [My Lenses Portal](https://my-lenses.snapchat.com/) (Under the apps tab). After that to build, install and launch  the `camerakit-sample-custom-carousel` on a connected device follow one of the following options:

### Command Line

- `./gradlew camerakit-sample-custom-carousel:installDebug`

- `adb shell am start -n com.snap.camerakit.sample.carousel/com.snap.camerakit.sample.carousel.MainActivity`

### IDE

Select the `camerakit-sample-custom-carousel` module configuration and click run:

## Steps to create custom layout and lenses carousel

1) Create a `ViewStub` that you will be passing to Camera Kit `Session` object. In this sample app
   this is done in `activity_main.xml` file with a `View` with `camera_kit_stub` ID. This `View`
   will be used to inflate a view hierarchy from the Camera Kit `Session` which includes rendering
   camera preview with a lens applied.
2) Attach the `ViewStub` to Camera Kit `Session` using its builder's `attachTo` method. This is done
   in `MainActivity.kt` file in this example.
3) In this sample we are using the Camera Kit's `CameraXImageProcessorSource` support class for the
   image processing input at the time of `Session` creation in `MainActivity.kt` file. However, you
   are free to use your own image processing input and connect it to `Session.processor` .
4) We are using `RecyclerView` with `GridLayoutManager` for the lenses carousel. Once you have the
   view hierarchy setup you can simply query the lenses repository from the `Session.lenses` object
   to fetch lenses group and fill the `RecyclerView` with the group's items using custom layout as a
   carousel.
5) Fetching from the lenses repository is done in the `MainActivity.kt` file using
   the `cameraKitSession.lenses.repository.observe` method - the retrieved list of lenses are then
   passed on to `LensesAdapter.kt` file as a list of `LensesComponent.Lens` objects.
